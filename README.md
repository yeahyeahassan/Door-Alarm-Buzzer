## Working Principle
1. **Power Supply:** The system is powered by a 9V battery or adapter.
2. **Reed Switch & Magnet:** Mounted on the door frame and door respectively. When the door is closed, the magnet keeps the reed switch in a closed state, completing the circuit.
3. **Circuit Interruption:** Opening the door moves the magnet away from the reed switch, opening the circuit.
4. **Triggering the Alarm:** Circuit interruption sends a signal to the BT136 Triac, activating the buzzer and LED.
5. **Visual Indicator:** LED provides a visual alert.
6. **System Reset:** Closing the door resets the system by completing the circuit.
